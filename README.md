## Welcome, I'm Shriya ðŸ‘‹

I am an M.Sc. Mathematics student at the Technical University of Munich, focusing on probability theory and machine learning. I recently completed my Master's thesis at the University of Cambridge, working in the intersection of causality and Bayesian optimization. Currently, I am a Software Engineering Intern at Intrinsic, focusing on 6D object pose estimation models.

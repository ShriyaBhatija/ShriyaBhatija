## Welcome, I'm Shriya ðŸ‘‹

I am an M.Sc. Mathematics student at TU Munich, currently wrapping up my studies with a thesis at the Cyber-Human Lab of the University of Cambridge. Here, I am focusing on how to find optimal interventions in causal graphs for which I am also establishing theoretical guarantees with Reinforcement Learning methods. Academically, I have a strong interest in data science, computer vision and machine learning. 

Previously, I have interned as a computer vision engineer at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Berlin as well as completed a research visit at the University of Tokyo.
